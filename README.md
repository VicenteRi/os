 So this is a super basic kernel from scratch, This will be updated frequently so the image may be outdated :(
 
 # Built with
 * C
 * Assembly

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites
Install [i686-elf-tools](https://github.com/lordmilko/i686-elf-tools) from Lordmilko for compiling

Install [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org) to test the os

## Compiling

after installing the tools insert the following command in the terminal

(*ONLY LINUX*)
 ```sh
 ./run.sh
 ```
 This will compile the OS, create a .iso in the main directory and run *qemu-system-i386*
 
 # To end
 
 I know that it can have many bugs and when it is compiled it ends up throwing an error but well I will try to solve everything and update this project
